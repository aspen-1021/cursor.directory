\section{Research Background (研究背景)}
\label{sec:research_background}

\subsection{Evolution of 3D Architectural Visualization Technology}
\label{subsec:evolution_3d_visualization}

The landscape of architectural visualization has undergone a profound transformation over the past three decades, evolving from static two-dimensional drawings to immersive, interactive three-dimensional environments. This evolution has been driven by rapid advances in computer graphics, rendering technologies, and human-computer interaction paradigms, fundamentally reshaping how architects, designers, and end-users conceptualize, communicate, and experience architectural spaces.

\subsubsection{Historical Development and Technological Milestones}
\label{subsubsec:historical_development}

The journey began in the 1980s with the introduction of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems, which primarily focused on technical documentation and geometric precision rather than visual communication. Early systems such as AutoCAD revolutionized the drafting process but offered limited capabilities for realistic visualization. The 1990s marked a significant turning point with the emergence of 3D modeling software like 3ds Max and Maya, originally developed for the entertainment industry but rapidly adopted by architectural professionals seeking more sophisticated visualization tools.

The advent of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the early 2000s represented a paradigm shift from mere visualization to comprehensive digital building lifecycle management. Platforms such as Autodesk Revit, ArchiCAD, and Bentley MicroStation integrated 3D modeling with parametric design capabilities, enabling architects to create intelligent building models that contained not only geometric information but also semantic data about materials, systems, and performance characteristics.

\subsubsection{Real-Time Rendering and Interactive Visualization}
\label{subsubsec:realtime_rendering}

The introduction of real-time rendering engines marked another revolutionary milestone in architectural visualization. Game engine technologies, particularly Unreal Engine and Unity, began finding applications in architectural contexts around 2010, enabling interactive walkthroughs and real-time design exploration. These platforms democratized high-quality visualization by reducing the computational time required for photorealistic rendering from hours to milliseconds, making interactive design review sessions feasible for the first time.

The integration of physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques has further enhanced the realism and accuracy of 3D architectural models. Modern rendering engines can now simulate complex lighting phenomena, material properties, and environmental conditions with unprecedented fidelity, creating visual experiences that closely approximate real-world conditions. This technological advancement has been crucial in bridging the gap between conceptual design and user perception of built environments.

\subsubsection{Immersive Technologies and Extended Reality}
\label{subsubsec:immersive_technologies}

The emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies has opened new frontiers in architectural visualization. VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and more recently, the Meta Quest series, have enabled fully immersive architectural experiences that allow users to navigate and interact with spaces at human scale. These technologies have proven particularly valuable for design validation, client presentations, and user experience testing before construction begins.

Augmented Reality has complemented VR by enabling the overlay of digital architectural information onto real-world environments. AR applications allow architects and clients to visualize proposed designs in their actual contexts, facilitating better decision-making regarding scale, proportion, and environmental integration. The development of mobile AR platforms, particularly Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore, has made these technologies more accessible to a broader user base.

\subsection{Current State of User Engagement in Digital Architectural Environments}
\label{subsec:current_user_engagement}

\subsubsection{Evolving User Expectations and Interaction Paradigms}
\label{subsubsec:evolving_expectations}

Contemporary users of architectural visualization tools exhibit increasingly sophisticated expectations regarding interactivity, responsiveness, and visual fidelity. The widespread adoption of high-resolution displays, touch interfaces, and gesture-based controls in consumer electronics has raised the bar for professional architectural applications. Users now expect intuitive navigation, real-time feedback, and seamless integration across multiple devices and platforms.

The democratization of 3D technologies has also expanded the user base beyond traditional architectural professionals. Real estate developers, marketing teams, facilities managers, and end-users now regularly interact with 3D architectural models for various purposes, from property marketing to space planning. This diversification has created new challenges in designing user interfaces that accommodate varying levels of technical expertise and domain knowledge.

\subsubsection{Multi-Modal Interaction and Accessibility}
\label{subsubsec:multimodal_interaction}

Modern 3D architectural visualization platforms increasingly support multi-modal interaction paradigms, combining traditional mouse and keyboard inputs with touch gestures, voice commands, and spatial controllers. The integration of haptic feedback technologies has begun to add tactile dimensions to digital architectural experiences, enabling users to ``feel'' material properties and spatial relationships.

Accessibility considerations have gained prominence as organizations recognize the importance of inclusive design in digital architectural tools. Screen reader compatibility, alternative input methods for users with mobility impairments, and visual accommodations for users with color vision deficiencies are becoming standard requirements rather than optional features.

\subsubsection{Cloud Computing and Collaborative Visualization}
\label{subsubsec:cloud_collaborative}

The shift toward cloud-based architectural visualization platforms has transformed the collaborative aspects of design review and decision-making processes. Platforms such as Autodesk Construction Cloud, Bentley iTwin, and various web-based viewers enable real-time collaboration among geographically distributed teams. These technologies have become particularly critical following the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the adoption of remote work practices in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.

Cloud computing has also enabled more sophisticated analytics and data collection capabilities. Organizations can now track user interactions with 3D models across multiple sessions and devices, creating opportunities for detailed behavioral analysis and user experience optimization. However, this increased data collection capability has also raised important questions about privacy, data ownership, and analytical methodology.

\subsection{The Gap Between Visual Representation and User Preferences}
\label{subsec:gap_visual_preferences}

\subsubsection{Limitations of Current Visualization Approaches}
\label{subsubsec:visualization_limitations}

Despite significant technological advances, a substantial gap persists between the visual information presented in 3D architectural models and users' actual preferences and decision-making processes. Traditional visualization approaches tend to prioritize photorealistic appearance over user experience metrics, often resulting in visually impressive but analytically limited representations.

Current 3D architectural models typically emphasize aesthetic qualities such as lighting, materials, and spatial composition while providing limited insight into how users actually perceive, navigate, and evaluate these spaces. This emphasis on visual fidelity over behavioral understanding represents a significant missed opportunity for evidence-based design optimization.

\subsubsection{Challenges in Measuring and Interpreting User Responses}
\label{subsubsec:measuring_user_responses}

The measurement of user engagement and preference in 3D architectural environments presents unique methodological challenges. Traditional user experience research methods, developed primarily for two-dimensional interfaces, often prove inadequate for three-dimensional spatial environments where users must navigate, orient themselves, and process complex visual information simultaneously.

Existing analytics tools typically capture basic interaction metrics such as click counts, session duration, and navigation paths, but fail to provide deeper insights into visual attention patterns, emotional responses, or preference formation mechanisms. The translation of these limited metrics into actionable design insights remains a significant challenge for both researchers and practitioners.

\subsubsection{Disconnect Between Design Intent and User Reception}
\label{subsubsec:design_intent_disconnect}

A fundamental disconnect often exists between architects' design intentions and users' actual experiences of digital architectural spaces. Designers may emphasize certain spatial qualities or material characteristics that users overlook or interpret differently than intended. This disconnect is particularly pronounced when cultural, demographic, or experiential differences exist between design teams and end-users.

The lack of systematic feedback mechanisms for capturing and analyzing user responses to specific design elements compounds this problem. Without robust methodologies for correlating visual features with user preferences, designers are often forced to rely on intuition, anecdotal feedback, or limited focus group data when making critical design decisions.

\subsubsection{Opportunities for Data-Driven Design Optimization}
\label{subsubsec:data_driven_opportunities}

The convergence of advanced computer vision techniques, machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive user tracking capabilities creates unprecedented opportunities for evidence-based design optimization. Pixel-level analysis of user visual attention patterns, combined with preference modeling and automated design generation, could potentially revolutionize how architectural products are developed and refined.

However, realizing this potential requires sophisticated analytical frameworks that can effectively bridge the gap between low-level visual data and high-level design insights. The development of such frameworks represents both a significant technical challenge and a transformative opportunity for the architectural visualization industry.

\subsubsection{Implications for Product Development and Innovation}
\label{subsubsec:product_development_implications}

The growing importance of user experience in architectural product development has created new demands for quantitative methods that can predict and optimize user engagement. Real estate developers, furniture manufacturers, and architectural service providers are increasingly seeking data-driven approaches to validate design decisions and optimize their offerings for target markets.

This trend toward evidence-based design has created a market need for analytical tools and methodologies that can effectively translate user interaction data into actionable business insights. Organizations that can successfully develop and deploy these capabilities are likely to gain significant competitive advantages in an increasingly data-driven marketplace.

The integration of user preference analysis into the design process also presents opportunities for more personalized and adaptive architectural experiences. As machine learning technologies mature, it may become feasible to create architectural visualization systems that automatically adapt their presentation and interaction modalities based on individual user characteristics and preferences.

\section{Problem Statement (问题陈述)}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

Despite the remarkable technological advances in 3D architectural visualization and the growing recognition of user-centered design principles, significant methodological and practical challenges persist in understanding, measuring, and optimizing user engagement with digital architectural environments. These challenges create substantial barriers to evidence-based design optimization and limit the potential for data-driven innovation in architectural product development. This research addresses three interconnected problem domains that collectively represent critical gaps in current practice and knowledge.

\subsection{Challenges in Measuring User Engagement with 3D Models}
\label{subsec:measuring_engagement_challenges}

\subsubsection{Inadequacy of Traditional Metrics in Spatial Environments}
\label{subsubsec:traditional_metrics_inadequacy}

The measurement of user engagement in three-dimensional architectural environments presents fundamental challenges that are not adequately addressed by conventional web analytics or user experience research methodologies. Traditional engagement metrics, such as page views, click-through rates, and session duration, were developed for linear, two-dimensional information consumption patterns and fail to capture the complexity of spatial navigation, visual exploration, and three-dimensional decision-making processes that characterize user interactions with architectural models.

In 3D environments, users engage in fundamentally different cognitive and behavioral processes compared to traditional digital interfaces. They must simultaneously process spatial relationships, navigate through virtual spaces, maintain orientation awareness, and evaluate multiple visual elements across different scales and perspectives. Existing measurement frameworks lack the granularity and dimensional sophistication required to capture these complex interaction patterns, resulting in oversimplified metrics that provide limited insight into actual user experience quality or preference formation mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Multi-Modal Interaction Complexity}
\label{subsubsec:multimodal_complexity}

Modern 3D architectural visualization platforms support increasingly diverse interaction modalities, including traditional mouse and keyboard inputs, touch gestures, voice commands, spatial controllers, and emerging technologies such as eye-tracking and haptic feedback. This multi-modal complexity creates significant challenges for developing unified measurement frameworks that can accurately capture and compare user engagement across different interaction paradigms.

The heterogeneity of interaction devices and techniques introduces additional complications in data normalization and comparative analysis. A user navigating a 3D architectural model using a VR headset with spatial controllers exhibits fundamentally different behavioral patterns compared to a user interacting with the same model through a traditional desktop interface. Current measurement approaches struggle to account for these modality-specific differences while maintaining analytical coherence and comparability across different user groups and interaction contexts.

\subsubsection{Temporal Dynamics and Context Sensitivity}
\label{subsubsec:temporal_dynamics}

User engagement with 3D architectural models exhibits complex temporal dynamics that are poorly captured by static or snapshot-based measurement approaches. Users' attention patterns, navigation strategies, and preference expressions evolve throughout their interaction sessions as they develop spatial understanding, discover new areas of interest, and refine their evaluation criteria. These temporal changes are influenced by factors such as prior architectural knowledge, cultural background, task objectives, and emotional responses to specific design elements.

Furthermore, engagement patterns are highly context-sensitive, varying significantly based on factors such as the purpose of interaction (\textit{e.g.}, professional design review versus casual exploration), the complexity of the architectural model, the quality of the visualization technology, and the physical environment in which the interaction takes place. Current measurement frameworks typically treat engagement as a static phenomenon, failing to account for these dynamic and contextual factors that significantly influence user behavior and preference formation.

\subsubsection{Scale and Granularity Challenges}
\label{subsubsec:scale_granularity}

3D architectural models operate across multiple scales simultaneously, from macro-level spatial organization to micro-level material details and surface textures. Users may engage with these different scales sequentially or simultaneously, creating complex multi-scale interaction patterns that are difficult to capture and analyze using existing methodological approaches. Traditional engagement metrics typically operate at single scales of analysis and cannot effectively integrate insights across different levels of spatial detail.

The granularity challenge is further complicated by the need to correlate user behavior with specific visual elements, architectural features, and design decisions. While users may express overall preferences for particular spaces or design alternatives, translating these high-level preferences into actionable insights about specific design elements requires much more granular analysis capabilities than are currently available in standard user experience research toolkits.

\subsection{Difficulty in Translating Visual Data to Actionable Insights}
\label{subsec:visual_data_translation}

\subsubsection{Semantic Gap Between Pixel-Level Data and Design Intent}
\label{subsubsec:semantic_gap}

One of the most significant challenges in contemporary 3D architectural visualization analytics lies in bridging the semantic gap between low-level visual data and high-level design insights. While modern computer vision techniques can effectively extract detailed information about user visual attention patterns, gaze trajectories, and interaction hotspots at the pixel level, translating this granular data into meaningful conclusions about architectural design preferences and optimization opportunities remains a largely unsolved problem.

The complexity of architectural visual information creates multiple layers of semantic meaning that must be decoded to generate actionable insights. A single pixel or image region may simultaneously represent multiple architectural elements (\textit{e.g.}, material properties, lighting conditions, spatial relationships, functional zones) that contribute differently to overall user perception and preference formation. Current analytical approaches typically lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities required to disentangle these multiple semantic layers and attribute user responses to specific design factors.

\subsubsection{Feature Attribution and Causality Inference}
\label{subsubsec:feature_attribution}

Understanding which specific visual features drive user engagement and preference formation represents a critical challenge for evidence-based design optimization. While machine learning algorithms can identify correlations between visual patterns and user responses, establishing causal relationships between specific design elements and user preferences requires more sophisticated analytical frameworks that can control for confounding variables and isolate the effects of individual design decisions.

The architectural design context introduces additional complexity because visual elements rarely exist in isolation. Colors, textures, lighting conditions, spatial proportions, and functional arrangements all interact in complex ways to create overall user experiences. Determining the relative importance of these different factors and understanding their interaction effects requires analytical approaches that can handle high-dimensional feature spaces while maintaining interpretability and actionability for design practitioners.

\subsubsection{Individual Differences and Personalization Challenges}
\label{subsubsec:individual_differences}

User responses to 3D architectural environments exhibit substantial individual variation based on factors such as cultural background, personal experience, aesthetic preferences, functional needs, and cognitive processing styles. While this individual variation is well-recognized in architectural design theory, current analytical frameworks typically rely on aggregate analysis approaches that may obscure important sub-group patterns or individual preference profiles that could inform more targeted design optimization strategies.

The challenge of personalization is further complicated by the need to balance individual preference accommodation with broader design objectives such as universal accessibility, cost constraints, regulatory compliance, and market appeal. Developing analytical frameworks that can simultaneously account for individual differences while identifying generalizable design principles represents a significant methodological challenge that current approaches have not adequately addressed.

\subsubsection{Real-Time Processing and Feedback Requirements}
\label{subsubsec:realtime_processing}

The increasing demand for interactive design optimization and real-time user feedback creates additional challenges for visual data analysis in 3D architectural environments. Design professionals and clients increasingly expect immediate insights and recommendations based on user interaction data, requiring analytical systems that can process complex visual information and generate actionable recommendations within seconds or minutes rather than hours or days.

This real-time processing requirement conflicts with the computational complexity of sophisticated computer vision and machine learning algorithms typically required for meaningful visual data analysis. Balancing analytical sophistication with processing speed requirements represents a significant technical challenge that limits the practical applicability of many existing research approaches in real-world design contexts.

\subsection{Need for Optimization Frameworks in Architectural Product Development}
\label{subsec:optimization_frameworks_need}

\subsubsection{Absence of Systematic Design Optimization Methodologies}
\label{subsubsec:systematic_methodologies_absence}

The architectural product development industry currently lacks systematic, evidence-based optimization frameworks that can effectively integrate user preference data with design generation and refinement processes. While individual architects and design firms may employ various user research methods and iterative design approaches, these efforts typically remain ad hoc, unsystematic, and difficult to replicate or scale across different projects and contexts.

The absence of standardized optimization methodologies creates several critical problems for the industry. Design decisions are often based on limited user feedback, designer intuition, or outdated precedents rather than systematic analysis of user preference patterns and engagement data. This approach may result in suboptimal design solutions that fail to maximize user satisfaction, functional performance, or market success, ultimately leading to reduced competitiveness and missed opportunities for innovation.

\subsubsection{Integration Challenges Between Analytics and Design Tools}
\label{subsubsec:integration_challenges}

Current architectural design workflows typically involve separate and poorly integrated systems for user analytics, design development, and performance evaluation. Designers may receive user feedback through isolated research studies or analytics reports, but lack effective mechanisms for translating these insights into specific design modifications or optimization strategies. This disconnect between analytical insights and design implementation creates significant barriers to evidence-based design optimization.

The integration challenge is compounded by the diversity of software platforms, data formats, and analytical methodologies employed across different stages of the design process. User interaction data may be collected in one system, analyzed using separate software platforms, and applied to design modifications in yet another application. This fragmented workflow creates opportunities for information loss, misinterpretation, and inefficient resource allocation that undermine the potential benefits of user-centered design approaches.

\subsubsection{Scalability and Standardization Constraints}
\label{subsubsec:scalability_constraints}

While individual case studies and pilot projects may demonstrate the potential benefits of user engagement analysis and design optimization, scaling these approaches to industry-wide adoption requires standardized frameworks, tools, and methodologies that can be reliably implemented across diverse organizational contexts and project types. Current research efforts typically focus on narrow application domains or specific technological platforms, limiting their broader applicability and adoption potential.

The standardization challenge is particularly acute in the architectural industry, where projects vary dramatically in scale, complexity, budget, timeline, and stakeholder requirements. Optimization frameworks must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate this diversity while maintaining analytical rigor and producing consistent, reliable results across different application contexts.

\subsubsection{Economic Justification and Return on Investment}
\label{subsubsec:economic_justification}

The development and implementation of sophisticated user engagement analysis and design optimization frameworks requires significant investments in technology, training, and process modification. However, the economic benefits of these investments are often difficult to quantify and demonstrate, creating barriers to organizational adoption and industry-wide transformation.

Architectural firms and product development organizations typically operate under significant time and budget constraints that limit their willingness to adopt new methodologies unless clear return on investment can be demonstrated. The lack of standardized performance metrics and benchmarking frameworks makes it difficult to evaluate the economic impact of user-centered design optimization approaches, perpetuating reliance on traditional design methods despite their recognized limitations.

\subsubsection{Ethical and Privacy Considerations}
\label{subsubsec:ethical_considerations}

The collection and analysis of detailed user behavior data in 3D architectural environments raises important ethical and privacy concerns that current frameworks have not adequately addressed. Users may be unaware of the extent of data collection occurring during their interactions with architectural visualization systems, and the potential applications of this data for design optimization, marketing, or other purposes may not be clearly disclosed or understood.

Furthermore, the use of sophisticated analytical techniques to infer user preferences and predict behavior raises questions about user autonomy, informed consent, and the potential for manipulative design practices. Developing optimization frameworks that can effectively leverage user data while maintaining ethical standards and protecting user privacy represents a critical challenge that must be addressed to ensure responsible innovation in the field.

\subsection{Research Imperative}
\label{subsec:research_imperative}

These interconnected challenges collectively demonstrate the urgent need for comprehensive research that can bridge the gap between pixel-level visual data analysis and actionable design optimization insights. The development of sophisticated analytical frameworks that can effectively measure user engagement in 3D architectural environments, translate complex visual data into meaningful design insights, and support systematic optimization processes represents both a significant methodological challenge and a transformative opportunity for the architectural visualization and product development industries.

The successful resolution of these challenges has the potential to fundamentally transform how architectural products are designed, evaluated, and optimized, enabling more user-centered, evidence-based approaches that can improve both user satisfaction and business outcomes. However, addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary research that integrates expertise from computer vision, human-computer interaction, machine learning, architectural design theory, and business optimization---a comprehensive approach that current research efforts have not yet fully achieved.
